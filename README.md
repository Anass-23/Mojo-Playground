## Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo ðŸ”¥ is not just another programming language. It's designed for AI developers, offering the usability of Python combined with the performance of C. Mojo unlocks unparalleled programmability of AI hardware and extensibility of AI models, making it the go-to language for all AI enthusiasts.

Mojo comes with a set of powerful features:

- **Progressive Types:**
  Leverage types for better performance and error checking.

- **Zero Cost Abstractions:**
  Take control of storage by inline-allocating values into structures.

- **Ownership + Borrow Checker:**
  Take advantage of memory safety without the rough edges.

- **Portable Parametric Algorithms:**
  Leverage compile-time meta-programming to write hardware-agnostic algorithms and reduce boilerplate.

- **Language Integrated Auto-Tuning:**
  Automatically find the best values for your parameters to take advantage of target hardware.

- **Full Power of MLIR:**
  Mojo provides the full power of MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation).

- **Parallel Heterogeneous Runtime:**
  Mojo supports a parallel heterogeneous runtime environment.

- **Fast Compile Times:**
  Experience fast compile times for efficient development.
